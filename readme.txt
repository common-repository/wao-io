== Description ==
 
[wao.io](https://wao.io/en/?utm_source=wordpressplugin&utm_medium=description&utm_campaign=landingpageperfopt) is a free plugin to test loading time and security of your wordpress site.

=== Performance Features ===

==== Image Optimization ====

The intelligent image optimization algorithm radically reduces file size without suffering a loss in quality.
You can choose between three levels of image compression.
wao.io optimizes your images by converting the original image into the best matching output format that your customer's client is capable of rendering.
 
==== Lazy Loading ====

Using lazy loading, your images will be loaded only shortly before they are visible to the user.
Preloading image placeholders in the size of the original images will prevent your site's layout from jumping around.
You decide which placeholder option integrates best in your overall webpage design

==== HTTP/2 Upgrade ====

Enabling wao.io provides an automatic HTTP/2 upgrade for your website.

==== Caching ====

Your content will be cached in our optimized varnish cache cluster.
In your personal control center you can clear the cache whenever necessary.

==== More Loadtime Optimization Features ====

* Head Re-ordering
* Legacy Optimization
* Code Minification
* Ressource Compression

=== Website Security Features ===

==== HTTPS/SSL Upgrade ====

wao.io provides an automated HTTPS/SSL upgrade for your website. Our powerful rewriting and
redirecting services ensure a smooth transition from HTTP to HTTPS.

==== Web Application Firewall ====

Using the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) wao.io's web application firewall provides
protection against many common attack categories, including the OWASP Top Ten.
The firewall will be updated periodically by our security experts.
